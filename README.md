# AI-Intervue

**AI-Intervue** is an interactive web-based interview platform built using Next.js. It leverages AI (Google Gemini) to generate customized interview questions based on user input. It also includes voice and video recording features for a more interactive experience, where candidates can record their responses to questions while the system keeps track of their audio and video.

## Project Flow

1. **Home Page**: 
   - The landing page introduces the platform and guides users to begin the interview process.

2. **Form Page**: 
   - Users fill in their details, such as:
     - **Position** they are applying for.
     - **Experience** level.
     - **Device Check** to ensure the camera and microphone are functional using the `getUserMedia` API.

4. **Voice and Video Recording**:
   - The system allows users to listen to each question, record their audio responses, and video using their deviceâ€™s camera.
   - The video and audio are captured every 30 seconds and sent to the backend for processing and storage.

5. **Submission and Thank You Page**:
   - Once all questions have been answered and recorded, users submit their responses.
   - The system then directs the user to a **Thank You** page confirming the successful submission of their interview session.
